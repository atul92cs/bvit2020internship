        <h5>Why external css is used?</h5>
        <p>External css makes our code much more readable and clean as the integration of
        the code and the tags are much more visible and changes can be made easily.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="second-body">
       <h6>Disadvantage</h6>
       <p>We have too many files to serve and with more page more css files have to be
         integrated</p>
     </div>
      <section id="third-body">
         <h2>So what to use?</h2>
         <p>Use the css externally mostly with fewer files and different name so that memory will be
         less occupied</p>
